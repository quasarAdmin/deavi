                                    the merger of two laboratories (LPG and LAOG). With almost 100 permanent staff in 2015, IPAG is one of the largest laboratories of the Observatory of Sciences of the Universe of Grenoble (OSUG).</p>
                                <p>Research areas at IPAG range from the planetary sub-surfaces to the outer reaches of the Universe, with a strong involvement in the study of stellar and planetary formation. A major part of these activities includes the
                                    design, the building and the scientific use of several instruments dedicated to the most powerful telescopes on Earth, as well as space missions.</p>
                                <p>Most of the astrophysics research being conducted at the University of Grenoble is done at IPAG, from laboratory experiments to theoretical calculations, including R&amp;D, the building of instruments, data processing,
                                    modelling and interpretation. Thanks to its international collaborations, foreign students and post-doctoral scientists, IPAG has emerged as a leading international institute on the Grenoble campus.</p>
