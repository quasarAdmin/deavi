                                <p class="text">Star Form Mapper is a European H2020 RIA project. The key aim of the project is to combine data from two of ESAâ€™s major space missions, Gaia and Herschel, together with ground based facilities, to constrain the mechanisms
                                    that underlie massive star and star cluster formation. Collectively, these facilities represent a considerable fraction of the total investment by Europe in astronomy. Taken separately, however, these missions give
                                    an incomplete picture but their combination will cover all stages from the formation of molecular cores, through the formation of stars, to the dispersal of the gas in young clusters. We will require new techniques
                                    in order to extract the full scientific value from this combination. We will develop new automated statistical techniques and common user tools that will provide wide benefits to the community. Our scientific results
                                    will underpin the study of how all galaxies evolve.</p>
